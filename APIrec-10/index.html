            The API that I want to use for my project is relatively similar to the dog CEO one that I am using, but I will have to figure out how I would be able to obtain pinterest's or google's API and build on top of that. I think I might use the same data that I did for this one, as my website would mainly be geared towards artists and such. I think that I might also use a similar design to this website, as the app attribute fits with my idea with the search bar element design that I was thinking of implementing.
        </p>

            However, I do think that I will need to research more on APIs as I was only able to figure out the dog CEO API because it gives you the link directly. At first I wanted to try and use genius lyrics' API, but I was unable to figure out how to use it or get the link to the API like the dog CEO one did. I think that it will also be much harder trying to figure out pinterest and google's API.
